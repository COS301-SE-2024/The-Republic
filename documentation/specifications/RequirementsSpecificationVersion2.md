# Requirement Specification

## Introduction

This document outlines the development of a Progressive Web App designed for users to post complaints about government service delivery. These posts will be analyzed and visualized to provide insights into government services.

This platform aims to improve citizen interaction with government services, fostering transparency, accountability, and engagement through organized incident reports and data visualization.

## User Stories and Characteristics

### Intended Users

**1. General Public**: Post complaints or compliments, view and interact with posts.

**2. Government Officials**: Monitor and respond to posts, generate reports.

### User Stories

---

#### ‚úèÔ∏è User Story 1: Posts

#### üìä User Story 3: Data Visualization and Analytics

---

**3.1. Viewing Data Analytics Visualizations**  
As a user, I want to view analytics based on the data generated on the platform and standard data visualizations in a visually appealing way, so that I can understand the state of different government services.

---

#### üë§ User Story 4: User Privacy

---

**4.1: User Anonymity**  
As a user, I want the option to post anonymously, so that I can control my privacy on the platform.

**4.2: User Profile**  
As a user, I want to share my details, such as username, surname, and email address, when I choose to, so that I can build a public profile on the platform.

---

#### üîë User Story 5: User Authentication

---

**5.1: Account Creation**  
As a user, I want to create an account with my details, so that I can have a personalized experience on the platform.

**5.2: Log In**  
As a user, I want to log in using my credentials, so that I can access my account and interact with the platform.

**5.3: Role Selection**  
As a user, I want to choose my role (general public, government official) during account creation, so that I can have a customized experience based on my role.

## üé® Design Patterns

**1. Singleton**: We will use the Singleton Pattern for managing user sessions in the User Management Module and for the Data Analytics Engine in the Data Analytics and Visualization Module. This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it, which is perfect for managing user sessions and ensuring there is only one active instance of the Data Analytics Engine.

**2. Observer**: We will use the Observer Pattern in the Post Management Module for notifying other parts of the system about changes in posts (like a new post being created). This pattern is beneficial because it allows us to maintain a list of observers which are automatically notified of any changes to the subject. This way, we can easily add or remove observers without modifying the subject's code.

**3. Factory**: We will use the Factory Pattern in the User Management Module for creating different types of users (regular user, municipal official, etc.), and in the Post Management Module for creating different types of posts. This pattern helps us encapsulate the complexities involved in creating different types of users and posts, making the code more maintainable and flexible.

**4. Strategy**: We will use the Strategy Pattern in the Data Analytics and Visualization Module for switching between different data analysis and visualization algorithms. This pattern is beneficial because it allows an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. This way, we can easily add new algorithms or modify existing ones without affecting the context class that uses them.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Constraints

1. The system must not follow a serverless model.
2. The system should not be cloud-native and must be able to run on one or more Linux VMs.
3. All libraries/services used must be open source.
