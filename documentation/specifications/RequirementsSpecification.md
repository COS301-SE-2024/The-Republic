## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Patterns
**1. Microservices**: The application will use a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability.
  - **Justification**: Microservices architecture divides the application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually. This supports performance by allowing independent scaling of services experiencing high load, enhances scalability by distributing the load across multiple services, and increases modularity by separating concerns into different services.

**2. Monolithic Architecture**: This pattern involves a single, unified codebase.
  - **Justification**: A monolithic architecture is simpler to develop and deploy initially, as it involves a single codebase and deployment pipeline. It can be a suitable choice for smaller applications or when development resources are limited. However, it may face challenges in scalability and maintainability as the application grows.

## üé® Design Patterns
**1. Singleton**: Ensuring a single instance of key classes, such as database connection managers.

**2. Observer**: For implementing real-time updates in the post feed and notifications.

**3. Factory**: To create different types of posts and visualisations dynamically.

**4. Decorator**: For adding functionality to posts such as tagging and filtering without modifying the original object.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Constraints
1. The system must not follow a serverless model.
2. The system should not be cloud-native and must be able to run on one or more Linux VMs.
3. All libraries/services used must be open source.
