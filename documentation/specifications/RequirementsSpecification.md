## üìÑ Service Contract
The following specifies our service contract.

### Base URL
In order to access the API URL you will need to run the server on your local machine. We will be deploying our backend at a later stage.
```
cd backend
npm i
npm run dev
```
You will see that the server is running on:
```
localhost:8080
```
### Authentication
All endpoints require authentication using a bearer token. The token should be included in the Authorization header of the request.
Header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-type: application/json
```
If the token is missing, invalid, or expired, the API will respond with a 401 Unauthorized status code.

## üîß Quality Requirements

### 1. Performance üöÄ
Performance requirements ensure that the system can handle a high volume of users and interactions without significant latency. Since we will have a large population using this app, the system should maintain high speed and responsiveness even with many users online.
- **FR3.1**: Users can create textual posts about governmental service delivery shortcomings and interactions.
- **FR3.2**: Users should be able to upload media (images) limited to 1 per post.
- **FR4.1**: Users can comment on other users‚Äô posts.
- **FR4.2**: Users can react to other users‚Äô posts.

### 2. Reliability üõ°Ô∏è

- **FR2.1**: Users can create accounts with a username, email address, and password.
- **FR2.2**: Users can log in using their credentials.
- **FR2.3**: Users can reset their password if forgotten.

### 3. Scalability üìà
Scalability requirements ensure that the system can handle growth in terms of users, data, and complexity. Since the platform is intended for the general public citizens of South Africa, it must be able to accommodate a large number of users and posts.
- **FR5.1**: Users can filter posts by department, date, or location.
- **FR5.2**: Users should see the feed according to their roles - different roles have different views.
- **FR5.3**: Filtered posts are displayed based on selected criteria.

### 4. Security üîí
Security requirements protect the system and its data from unauthorized access and potential harm. Unauthorized access should not be possible, so only people with verified credentials should be able to perform certain actions. Municipal officials, for instance, will have specific roles that are verified and restricted.
- **FR2.4**: Users can update their account details.
- **FR2.5**: Users can select their role during account creation.
- **FR4.4**: Government officials should be able to view a user‚Äôs profile.
- **FR4.5**: Government officials should be able to message any user to follow up.

### 5. Maintainability üîß
Maintainability requirements ensure that the system can be easily updated and improved over time. The system should be maintainable because future improvements and the addition of new functionalities like integration with external services will be necessary.
- **FR1.1**: Users can manage their profile display name.
- **FR1.2**: Users can choose to post anonymously.
- **FR1.3**: Users can change their profile roles.
- **FR1.4**: Users should be able to update their profile picture.

### 6. Usability üñêÔ∏è
Usability requirements ensure that the system is easy to use and provides a good user experience for individuals of diverse backgrounds, including different age groups and abilities. The system should be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that users, regardless of age or disability, can easily interact with it and perform necessary actions.
- **FR1.5**: Users should be able to view their own posts on their profile.
- **FR3.3**: Users should be able to choose the category of the issue when posting.
- **FR3.4**: Users should be able to pick their location showing their municipality when making a post.
- **FR5.4**: Users can view standard data analytics visualisations.
- **FR5.5**: Users should be able to see data visualisation solely based on their filter selected.
- **FR6.1**: Users should be able to create a report according to the dates and locations they choose.
- **FR6.2**: Reports should be statistically shown with analytics visualisation.



## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Patterns
**Monolithic Architecture**: This architecture is chosen for its simplicity and ease of deployment, combining all functionalities into a single, unified application. It integrates User Management, Post Management, and Data Analytics and Visualisation modules, ensuring cohesive functionality and efficient data management. Postgres is used as a robust and reliable data store, providing consistent and efficient handling of large volumes of data. This approach meets core requirements effectively while being scalable and modular for future evolution.

</div>

## üé® Design Patterns
**1. Singleton**: Ensuring a single instance of key classes, such as database connection managers.

**2. Observer**: For implementing real-time updates in the post feed and notifications.

**3. Factory**: To create different types of posts and visualisations dynamically.

**4. Decorator**: For adding functionality to posts such as tagging and filtering without modifying the original object.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Constraints
1. The system must not follow a serverless model.
2. The system should not be cloud-native and must be able to run on one or more Linux VMs.
3. All libraries/services used must be open source.
