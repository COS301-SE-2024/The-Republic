# Introduction

The Republic is a platform aimed at revolutionizing citizen engagement with government services. This document outlines the architectural design of The Republic project, focusing on the system's performance, scalability, reliability, security, maintainability, and usability while facilitating future evolution from a monolithic to a microservice architecture.

# Design Strategy üìÉ

## Alignment with Business Requirements:

The architectural decisions and identification of quality requirements were made to directly align with the core business requirements of The Republic project. The functional requirements and user stories outline the need for a platform that allows citizens to report governmental service delivery issues and visualize the aggregated data. To meet these business needs effectively, the architectural choices and prioritized quality requirements were carefully selected.

Furthermore, the prioritization of quality requirements such as performance, reliability, scalability, security, and usability directly addresses the business need for a robust, responsive, and user-friendly platform capable of handling a large user base. By ensuring high performance, reliability, and scalability, the system can effectively serve the intended audience of the general public, facilitating seamless reporting of service delivery issues and providing insightful visualizations.
The emphasis on security and usability aligns with the business requirement of fostering trust and encouraging widespread adoption among citizens. A secure platform that protects user data and provides an intuitive user experience will be crucial for the project's success and sustained utilization.

## User-Centric Design:

As the platform targets the general public, including individuals from diverse backgrounds and demographics, addressing their requirements is paramount. Key considerations include:

- **Intuitive User Experience:** Prioritizing usability ensures that the platform is easy to navigate and interact with, regardless of the user's technical proficiency or ability. This aligns with the quality requirement of delivering a user-friendly experience that encourages widespread adoption.
- **Accurate and Relevant Information:** By emphasizing reliability and performance, the platform can provide citizens with accurate and up-to-date visualizations and insights into governmental service delivery. This transparency and information accuracy foster trust and enable informed decision-making.
- **Consistent Availability:** Aligning with the reliability quality requirement, the system must remain consistently accessible and operational, especially during critical situations when citizens need to report service delivery issues promptly.
- **Responsive Interactions:** Focusing on performance ensures that the platform responds swiftly to user inputs, queries, and interactions, providing a seamless and efficient experience that meets citizens' expectations for responsiveness.

This user-centric approach not only enhances the overall experience but also increases the likelihood of sustained engagement and utilization, aligning with the overarching business objectives of the project.

## Facilitates Long-term Maintenance:

By prioritizing aspects such as modularity, code quality, and comprehensive documentation, the system can be effectively maintained and evolved over time. Specific considerations include:

- **Modular Design:** Structuring the application into independent, self-contained modules or components promotes maintainability. This modular approach simplifies the process of updating, replacing, or extending specific functionalities without compromising the entire system's integrity.
- **Robust Coding Practices:** Adherence to industry-standard coding conventions, rigorous code reviews, and automated testing frameworks contribute to a high-quality, maintainable codebase. This proactive approach minimizes technical debt and facilitates efficient identification and resolution of issues.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Maintaining detailed and up-to-date documentation not only aids in knowledge transfer among development teams but also serves as a valuable resource for future maintenance and enhancement efforts. Well-documented code, architecture, and processes ensure smoother transitions and minimize the risk of disruptions.

While strategies like decomposition and test case generation are undoubtedly valuable and will be employed throughout the project lifecycle, the primary architectural design strategy centers on addressing key quality requirements.

# Quality Requirements

The following Quality Requirements have been identified by the team and the client. They are listed in order of importance and discussed in some detail below.

- **1. Performance**
- **2. Reliability**
- **3. Scalability**
- **4. Security**
- **5. Maintainability**
- **6. Usability**

## Performance üöÄ

Performance requirements ensure that the system can handle a high volume of users and interactions without significant latency. The system must maintain high speed and responsiveness even under load.

- **Caching:** Implementing caching strategies at multiple levels to reduce load times and improve response speeds. Frequently accessed data is cached to minimize database queries.
- **Load Balancing:** Using load balancers to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers. This ensures that no single server becomes a bottleneck, maintaining system performance even during peak usage.
- **Optimized Queries:** Database queries are optimized to handle large volumes of data efficiently. Indexing and query optimization techniques are employed to ensure quick data retrieval.

## Reliability üõ°Ô∏è

Reliability ensures that the system is available and functional when users need it. Users should be able to perform critical tasks like creating accounts, posting, or resetting passwords without issues.

- **Redundancy:** Critical components must have redundant systems in place to handle failures gracefully. This includes redundant servers, databases, and network connections.
- **Backups:** Regular backups of all critical data ensure that data can be restored quickly in case of a failure, minimizing downtime and data loss.

## Scalability üõ°Ô∏è

The system is built to scale efficiently to handle growth in users, data, and complexity.

- **Microservices Architecture** Although currently using a monolithic design, the system is planned to transition to a microservices architecture. This will allow different functionalities to be managed independently and scaled as needed.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Services are designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances to handle increased load, ensuring that performance remains stable as the user base grows.
- **Database Partitioning:** Employing database partitioning and sharding to manage data growth efficiently. This ensures that large datasets are handled effectively without degrading performance.
