# Architectural Patterns üî®

## Layered Pattern

A layered architecture can help improve performance by separating concerns, allowing for optimization at each layer. Each layer has a well-defined responsibility, ensuring cleaner code and easier maintenance. The presentation layer handles the user interface, the logic layer manages business rules, and the data access layer interacts with the database. Security can be ensured at multiple levels as well thus improving security.

<img src="../images/diagrams/Layered.jpg"/>

## Micro-Services

Microservices architecture can enhance reliability by isolating failures to specific services, preventing a single point of failure and it supports horizontal scaling, improving scalability.

<img src="../images/diagrams/Microservice.jpg"/>

## Components Based Pattern

Our frontend utilizes a component-based architecture, allowing for the reuse of individual components across different parts of the application. This approach minimizes code duplication and enhances the consistency of the user interface. Each component is designed to be independently testable, aligning with our structural style and test-driven development methodology.

<img src="../images/diagrams/Components.jpg"/>

## Client-Server Pattern

Our system is designed using a client-server architecture. In this setup, the frontend acts as a client that requests data from the backend server. The backend server then provides content to multiple clients. This separation of frontend and backend components allows them to function independently, facilitating easier testing of individual components due to their loose coupling.

- **User Management:** The backend server manages user authentication, registration, and profile management functionality through a User Management Service. This service would handle user-related data and enforce access controls.
- **Post Management:** This service is responsible for managing user posts, comments, reactions, and providing filtering/sorting functionality for the posts.
- **Data Analytics and Visualization:** This component performs sentiment analysis on user posts, processes the data, and generates visualizations based on the analyzed data. It may utilize machine learning models or data processing pipelines to extract insights from the user-generated content.
- **Security and Access Control:** The backend server is responsible for implementing security measures, such as entry point validation, token-based middleware for session management, and enforcing role-based access controls to protect sensitive data and ensure authorized access.
- **Database Management:** The backend server manages the interactions with the primary database for storing and retrieving data related to users, posts, and other application data.
