## Security üîí

The system addresses the crucial attribute of security with a comprehensive, layered approach to protect sensitive data and ensure secure user interactions.

- **Entry Point Validation:** At the initial entry point, all incoming requests are validated and sanitized to defend against malformed or malicious data. This serves as the first line of defense, preventing potentially harmful requests from reaching deeper layers of the system.
- **API Gateway:** Acting as the main entry point to the system, the API Gateway further screens and filters incoming requests. It uses token-based middleware to manage sessions securely. This middleware ensures that only authorized users with valid session tokens can access the system, thereby preventing unauthorized access.
- **Service-Level Security:** Within the system, individual services such as User Management enforce strict access controls. Only users with the correct permissions can access or modify sensitive information. For example, the User Management service uses a dedicated PostgreSQL database with role-based access control to ensure that sensitive user data is protected.
- **Data Storage Security:** The system ensures that sensitive information is masked, and access is restricted to read-only where appropriate, thus maintaining data integrity and confidentiality. Additionally, compliance with data protection regulations, such as the POPI Act, is ensured by implementing necessary data masking and encryption protocols.

# Architectural Strategies üî®

## Components

Our frontend utilizes a component-based architecture, allowing for the reuse of individual components across different parts of the application. This approach minimizes code duplication and enhances the consistency of the user interface. Each component is designed to be independently testable, aligning with our structural style and test-driven development methodology.

<img src="../images/diagrams/Architectura.jpg"/>

## Client-Server

Our system is designed using a client-server architecture. In this setup, the frontend acts as a client that requests data from the backend server. The backend server then provides content to multiple clients. This separation of frontend and backend components allows them to function independently, facilitating easier testing of individual components due to their loose coupling.

- **User Management:** The backend server manages user authentication, registration, and profile management functionality through a User Management Service. This service would handle user-related data and enforce access controls.
- **Post Management:** This service is responsible for managing user posts, comments, reactions, and providing filtering/sorting functionality for the posts.
- **Data Analytics and Visualization:** This component performs sentiment analysis on user posts, processes the data, and generates visualizations based on the analyzed data. It may utilize machine learning models or data processing pipelines to extract insights from the user-generated content.
- **Security and Access Control:** The backend server is responsible for implementing security measures, such as entry point validation, token-based middleware for session management, and enforcing role-based access controls to protect sensitive data and ensure authorized access.
- **Database Management:** The backend server manages the interactions with the primary database for storing and retrieving data related to users, posts, and other application data.

<img src="../images/diagrams/Client Server.jpg"/>

## REST

The application leverages a RESTful API for communication between client and server. This approach, characterized by stateless interactions, minimizes server load and enhances the application's scalability.

- **Stateless Communication:** RESTful APIs follow a stateless communication protocol, which means that each request from the client contains all the necessary information for the server to understand and process it. This stateless approach reduces server overhead and improves scalability.
- **Separation of Concerns:** The use of RESTful APIs promotes a clear separation between the client (frontend) and server (backend) components, enabling them to evolve independently and facilitating easier testing and maintenance.
- **Scalability:** The stateless nature of RESTful APIs reduces server load, contributing to the overall scalability of the application. The server can handle a higher volume of requests more efficiently.
- **Caching Capabilities:** RESTful APIs support caching mechanisms, which can further improve performance and reduce server load by serving cached responses for repeated requests.

## Pipe - Filter

The data processing pipeline can be enhanced by applying the pipe-filter pattern. This approach breaks down the processing stages into distinct modules, each acting as a "filter" that performs a specific task on the data.

- **Sequential Processing:** The conversion of data (e.g., data transformations, validations, calculations) can happen in sequential phases. Each phase processes the input data, applies the necessary transformations, and outputs the data for the next phase.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Implementing a pipe-filter pattern helps in separating concerns. Each filter (module) is responsible for a specific task, making the system easier to understand, maintain, and test.
- **Scalability and Maintainability:** Organizing the system into smaller, well-defined processing stages enhances scalability and maintainability. Individual filters can be optimized or refactored without affecting the entire system.
