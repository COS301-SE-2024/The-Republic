### üë• User Stories and Characteristics

#### üè∑Ô∏è Intended Users
1. General Public: Create organizations, join existing ones, and participate in organization activities.

#### üìö User Stories

##### ‚úèÔ∏è User Story 1: Organization Creation and Management
1.1. Create Organization
As a user, I want to create a new organization with details such as name, description, logo, and website, etc. so that I can establish a community around shared interests or locations.

1.2. Update Organization Details
As an organization admin, I want to update the organization's details, so that I can keep the information current and relevant.

1.3. Delete Organization
As an organization admin, I want to delete the organization when it's no longer needed, ensuring all related data is properly handled - ensure that no other existing data is deleted by mistake when an org is deleted.

##### üîë User Story 2: Membership Management
2.1. Join Organization
As a user, I want to request to join, or join openly, an existing organization.

2.2. Set Join Policy
As an organization admin, I want to set and change the join policy (open or request to join), so that I can control how new members are added.

2.3. Manage Join Requests
As an organization admin, I want to approve or reject join requests of users for organizations with a "request to join" policy, so that I can curate the organization's membership.

2.4. Remove Members
As an organization admin, I want to remove members from the organization when necessary, so that I can maintain the integrity of the organization if needs be.

##### üìä User Story 3: Organization Interaction and Reporting
3.1. View Organizations
As a user, I want to view a list of organizations I can join (press join button), so that I can find relevant groups to participate in.

3.2. Generate Reports
As an organization admin, I want to generate detailed reports about the organization's activities, including issues raised and individual user contributions, so that I can track the organization's impact and member engagement, as the data can be valuable.
